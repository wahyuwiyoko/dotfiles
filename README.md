# Dotfiles

i3, bspwm, Sway, and many other software configurations and scripts for my desktop.

I try to avoid using Nerd Fonts or any other patched fonts, so there are
no icons included.

All setup and installer scripts are available in [setup](setup/) directory.

You can find a list of wallpaper that I liked in
[screenshots/wallpapers.md](screenshots/wallpapers.md).

## Screenshots

You can look Neovim screenshot in
[screenshots/neovim.png](screenshots/neovim.png).

### i3 + i3status

My first tiling window manager, because it's well documented for new user.

### bspwm + Polybar

I like how bspwm have dynamic tiling and monocle layout.

### Sway + Waybar

I'm glad that there is an _i3-like_ for Wayland. It's my main window
manager by now, just because it's smoother and simpler than X11.

## Notes

- Different distribution have different packages name.
- View the scripts and configurations first before using it.
- Change the configurations according to your hardware and applications that
  you need.
- If you want to start X manually using `startx`, modify the
  [~/.config/X11/xsession](.config/X11/xsession) file and add `xinput`
  configuration before execute the window manager.

## Tips

- For more details about my set up and some packages that I used, you can read
  [my Debian setup](https://wahyuwiyoko.github.io/blog/linux/my-debian-setup/)
  post.
- I also had an article
  [how to enable touchpad tap-to-click](https://wahyuwiyoko.github.io/blog/linux/enable-touchpad-tap-to-click/)
  if you are curios how to enable it.
- If you want sxhkd to have like i3 binding mode, you can do that by following
  this example [issue](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd/issues/58).
- To disable bluetooth:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth
sudo systemctl mask bluetooth.target
```

- If you want to tweak Xorg driver for Intel graphics, see the man pages for
  more details: `man intel`
- To know what keybinds pressed, use `xev` for X11, and `wev` for Wayland.
- If you have a cursor theme that stored in system-wide (`/usr/share/icons`)
  and want to use for spesific/local user, symlink the icon cursor directory to
  `~/.local/share/icons` and change the `Inherits` value inside
  `~/.local/share/icons/default/index.theme` according to your icons directory
  name.
