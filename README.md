# Dotfiles

i3, bspwm, Sway, and many other software configurations and scripts for my desktop.

I try to avoid using Nerd Fonts or any other font icons, so there are no icons
included on all of my configuration.

All setup and installer scripts are available in [setup](setup/) directory.

You can find a list of wallpaper that I liked in
[screenshots/wallpapers.md](screenshots/wallpapers.md).

## Screenshots

### i3 + i3status

My first tiling window manager, because it's well documented for new user.

### bspwm + Polybar

I like how bspwm have dynamic tiling and monocle layout.

### Sway + Waybar

I'm glad that there is an _i3-like_ for Wayland. It's my main window
manager by now, just because it's smoother and simpler than X11.

  configuration before execute the window manager.
